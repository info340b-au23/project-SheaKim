    <h2>Problem Domain</h2>
    Although pandemic restrictions have been lifted, Covid-19 is still a prominent issue within our society, 
    especially on college campuses. The main issue at hand is the need for a user-friendly tool that allows 
    for personal sickness tracking for students and faculty, as well as real-time information on COVID-19 cases on campus. 
    The UW covid tracker is an application aimed to address the challenge of tracking and managing coronavirus 
    cases within the University of Washington campus, enhancing campus safety measures.  
    The initial solution provided by the university is the University of Washington COVID-19 Information website. 
    This educates individuals on COVID-19 facts and steps to take to protect others. 
    The UW covid tracker will enhance this information, by displaying an comprehensive platform that 
    informs users on covid-19 cases throughout the university. The application will create interactive 
    maps that are constantly updated to show the distribution of COVID-19 cases on campus. Furthermore, there will 
    be a personal sickness tracker feature, that will provide users with recommendations based on their own health 
    and symptoms. Finally, there will be forums and chats, where communities can engage to promote a safer environment.

    <h2>App Description</h2>
    more content here (to be pasted in)

    <h3>Our Users</h3>
    The users of this application are those affiliated with the University of Washington,
    including but not limited to students (our expected main audience), faculty, administrators,
    and custodial staff. To be more specific, 
    we expected some of our most important users to be those who are disabled or immunocompromised, 
    as we expect them to benefit the most from tracking the health of themselves and others.

    <h3>The Features</h3>
    <li>The main thing that users will do is anonymously notify those who were near them when
        they were actively sick with COVID-19 or even a different common temporary illness
        such as colds or fevers, through a campus map that displays the number of those who were sick
        in certain areas/buildings and during what times. This map will display data input by sick users
        to automatically create visualizations indicating where the most people have been sick 
        and with what illness.</li>
    <li>Another feature we plan to implement is a personal illness tracker. This information will be kept
        private to the user only and is an optional feature for them to log details about the times
        they were sick. Once a user becomes sick, they can go into their personal information and
        record details about their sickness, including start date, symptoms, and measures taken to
        treat the illness. This creates a personal medical record for them to
        look back on in the future potentially when treating more serious illnesses, or even just to compare
        current immune system reactions to past ones.
    </li>
    <li>A third feature we plan to implement is a community health resource sharing feature.
        With this feature, sick users can post requests and also available resources for those who are
        ill and live near their location. Users can then arrange a contactless pick up time to deliver
        resources such as sickness meds, foods, masks, COVID-19 tests, and more. We mainly expect this
        feature to be used by students who live on-campus near other students, but it can be implemented
        to UW surrounding areas as well. To avoid potential abuse of this feature (eg. selling products),
        users will only be able to choose kinds of resources from dropdown menus.
