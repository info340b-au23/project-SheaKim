    <h3>Our Users</h3>
    The users of this application are those affiliated with the University of Washington,
    including but not limited to students (our expected main audience), faculty, administrators,
    and custodial staff. To be more specific, 
    we expected some of our most important users to be those who are disabled or immunocompromised, 
    as we expect them to benefit the most from tracking the health of themselves and others.
