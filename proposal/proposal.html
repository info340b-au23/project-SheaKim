    <h2>Problem Domain</h2>
    Although pandemic restrictions have been lifted, Covid-19 is still a prominent issue within our society, 
    especially on college campuses. The main issue at hand is the need for a user-friendly tool that allows 
    for personal sickness tracking for students and faculty, as well as real-time information on COVID-19 cases on campus. 
    The UW covid tracker is an application aimed to address the challenge of tracking and managing coronavirus 
    cases within the University of Washington campus, enhancing campus safety measures.  
    The initial solution provided by the university is the University of Washington COVID-19 Information website. 
    This educates individuals on COVID-19 facts and steps to take to protect others. 
    The UW covid tracker will enhance this information, by displaying an comprehensive platform that 
    informs users on covid-19 cases throughout the university. The application will create interactive 
    maps that are constantly updated to show the distribution of COVID-19 cases on campus. Furthermore, there will 
    be a personal sickness tracker feature, that will provide users with recommendations based on their own health 
    and symptoms. Finally, there will be forums and chats, where communities can engage to promote a safer environment.

    <h3>Our Users</h3>
    The users of this application are those affiliated with the University of Washington,
    including but not limited to students (our expected main audience), faculty, administrators,
    and custodial staff. To be more specific, 
    we expected some of our most important users to be those who are disabled or immunocompromised, 
    as we expect them to benefit the most from tracking the health of themselves and others.
