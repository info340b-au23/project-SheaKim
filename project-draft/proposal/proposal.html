                <h2>Problem Domain</h2>
                <p>
                    Although pandemic restrictions have been lifted, Covid-19 is still a prominent issue within our
                    society, especially on college campuses. The main issue at hand is the need for a user-friendly
                    tool that allows for personal sickness tracking for students and faculty, as well as real-time
                    information on COVID-19 cases on campus. The UW covid tracker is an application aimed to address
                    the challenge of tracking and managing coronavirus cases within the University of Washington campus,
                    enhancing campus safety measures. The initial solution provided by the university is the University
                    of Washington COVID-19 Information website. We have researched other ways to get real-time
                    information
                    on COVID-19, Such as <a href="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2021/3/e24322" target="_blank">Health Apps
                        for Combating
                        COVID-19: Descriptive Review and Taxonomy</a> by Manal Almakli, who explain that use of the
                    technology can
                    address the propagation of COVID-19 and diverse applications of these technologies in healthcare as
                    a response to this public health crisis. Using what we have learned from Almakli's article, we
                    wanted to educated
                    individuals on COVID-19 facts and steps to take to protect others at our university.
                    The UW covid tracker will enhance this information, by displaying an comprehensive platform that
                    informs users on covid-19 cases throughout the university. The application will create interactive
                    maps that are constantly updated to show the distribution of COVID-19 cases on campus. Furthermore,
                    there will be a personal sickness tracker feature, that will provide users with recommendations
                    based on their
                    own health and symptoms. Finally, there will be forums and chats, where communities can engage to
                    promote a
                    safer environment.

                <h2>App Description</h2>

                <h3>Our Users</h3>
                <p>
                    The users of this application are those affiliated with the University of Washington,
                    including but not limited to students (our expected main audience), faculty, administrators,
                    and custodial staff. To be more specific,
                    we expected some of our most important users to be those who are disabled or immunocompromised,
                    as we expect them to benefit the most from tracking the health of themselves and others.
                </p>



                <!--Features-->
                <section>
                    <h3>The Features</h3>
                    <li>The main thing that users will do is anonymously notify those who were near them when
                        they were actively sick with COVID-19 or even a different common temporary illness
                        such as colds or fevers, through a campus map that displays the number of those who were sick
                        in certain areas/buildings and during what times. This map will display data input by sick users
                        to automatically create visualizations indicating where the most people have been sick
                        and with what illness. Our motatvation comes from an article called
                        <a href="https://www.slu.edu/news/2021/january/covid-tracking-app.php" target="_blank">SLU
                            Researchers Develop App to Track COVID-19 Symptoms</a>
                        who have also incorpated geospatial data in their aplications We have belive that leveraging
                        geospatial technology
                        to advance, educate, and enhance public health exemplifies how health and its outcomes are
                        influenced by
                        location, as evidenced by the impact of COVID-19.
                    </li>
                    <li>Another feature we plan to implement is a personal illness tracker. This information will be
                        kept
                        private to the user only and is an optional feature for them to log details about the times
                        they were sick. Once a user becomes sick, they can go into their personal information and
                        record details about their sickness, including start date, symptoms, and measures taken to
                        treat the illness. This creates a personal medical record for them to
                        look back on in the future potentially when treating more serious illnesses, or even just to
                        compare
                        current immune system reactions to past ones.
                    </li>
                    <li>A third feature we plan to implement is a community health resource sharing feature.
                        With this feature, sick users can post requests and also available resources for those who are
                        ill and live near their location. Users can then arrange a contactless pick up time to deliver
                        resources such as sickness meds, foods, masks, COVID-19 tests, and more. We mainly expect this
                        feature to be used by students who live on-campus near other students, but it can be implemented
                        to UW surrounding areas as well. To avoid potential abuse of this feature (eg. selling
                        products),
                        users will only be able to choose kinds of resources from dropdown menus.

                <h3>The Data</h3>
                <p>
                    The main data users will be viewing is Google Maps data. Using an API, we plan to display live
                    Google Maps along with user input data that is automatically cleaned, filtered, and visualized for
                    users.
                    The link to the API can be found <a
                        href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-started">here</a>
                    (Note: we as a group are very unfamiliar with using APIs so we hope to learn more about implementing
                    them through this project).

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    This app solves the need for student illness trackers here at the University of Washington,
                    and aims to improve community health through resource sharing and anonymous self-reporting.
